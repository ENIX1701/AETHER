# Release plan (v1.1)

- [ ] Further parametrize GHOST payloads -> add severities (no severity -> encrypting a dummy file; max severity -> encrypting the bootloader/system directory/etc.)
- [ ] Make CHARON be able to search through exfiltrated files (or save them somewhere sensible). This can also include SHADOW serving them on some endpoint, w/e makes more sense
