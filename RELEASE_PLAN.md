# Release plan (v1.0)

## 1. Objectives

The goal of AETHER v1.0 is to provide a fully integrated C2 framework where SHADOW, CHARON and GHOST function seamlessly together.

**Definition of done taget:**
- Full integration of all three modules
- Deployment via single docker compose file
- Full technical documentation for each module
- Full user guide for each module
- GHOST deployment workflow established (possible one-line bash script generated by CHARON)

## 2. Current status and missing components

### Ready

- CHARON, GHOST and SHADOW are individually functional in current scope
- CHARON <-> SHADOW <-> GHOST integrations complete
- SHADOW has full API test coverage

### Missing

- GHOST deploy orchestration in AETHER docker compose
- GHOST builder

## 3. Deployment strategy

- Central docker compose that builds CHARON and SHADOW, and creates an internal network for them
- Users use CHARON to build a GHOST that will be available at `SHADOW/download` and will provide a command to run it on the target

## Checklist

- [ ] GHOST builder in CHARON
- [ ] SHADOW serves ready GHOST binaries
- [ ] Redo AETHER README
- [ ] Manually test whole flow descibed in main README
- [ ] Tag v1.0 in git
